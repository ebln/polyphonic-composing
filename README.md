Polyphonic Composer Configurations
==================================

Experiment on running different `composer.json`s with possibly different dependencies within the same codebase.

The best way from the dependency hell into the dependency-hell-resolution hell! :shrug:

## RAVELIN
ACL, Bastion etcâ€¦ TBD

## TODOs
* experiment with unix sockets
* `Symbiont` still callable i.e autoloadable from root flavour
  * look into https://packagist.org/packages/mcaskill/composer-exclude-files
* `post-autoload-dump` for installing / dumping autoloader for the symbionts
  * automate for all subdirectories in polyphony
